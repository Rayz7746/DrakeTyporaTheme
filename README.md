# Description

This theme is a fusion of [`drake-dark`](https://github.com/liangjingkanji/DrakeTyporaTheme) and [`mdmdt`](https://github.com/cayxc/Mdmdt). It combines the image positioning functionality from mdmdt with enhanced fonts and refined styling from drake-dark to create a more elegant writing experience. Please support the original authors if you find this theme useful.

If you want to see full styling, please download and open `主题演示demo.md`. It's from author of [`mdmdt`](https://github.com/cayxc/Mdmdt), where has plenty of styling to test with.

*Note: This README is modified from the original Drake theme documentation.*
